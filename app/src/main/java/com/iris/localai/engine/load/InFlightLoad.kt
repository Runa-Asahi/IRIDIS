/**
 * 2.1.7: the model load that is running (or queued) right now, shared by everyone who needs a model.
 *
 * Before, a message sent while model B was loading went through `ensureLoaded()`, which saw
 * "not Ready", fell back to the *last used* model A, queued a load of A behind B and then threw B
 * away — the reply came from the wrong model after two loads. Now every load registers here and
 * `ensureLoaded()` (no explicit model) awaits the in-flight one, whatever model it is, and answers
 * with it. Pure (no Android) so the coordination is unit-tested (v217ux/LoadCoordinationTest).
